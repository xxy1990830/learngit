The innovation has been enthusiastically supported in the Internet.Users are encouraged to try this opportunity, so that the company could extend its list of sites accepting Bitcoins.

The Marvin initiative has also found support in the Runet. Commentators ironically point out that the news arrived on Valentine's Day.
